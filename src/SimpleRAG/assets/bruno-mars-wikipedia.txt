Bruno Mars: Wikipedia

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Peter Gene Hernandez (born October 8, 1985), known professionally as Bruno Mars, is an American singer-songwriter, musician, and record producer. Regarded as a pop icon, he is known for his three-octave tenor vocal range, live performances, retro showmanship and musical versatility. He is accompanied by his band, the Hooligans. Raised in Honolulu, Mars gained recognition in Hawaii as a child for his impersonation of Elvis Presley, before moving to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a musical career.

Mars established his name in the music industry as a songwriter and co-founder of the production team the Smeezingtons. He rose to fame as a recording artist after featuring on the US number-one single "Nothin' on You" (2009) by B.o.B. Mars' first three studio albums – Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010), Unorthodox Jukebox (2012) and 24K Magic (2016) – found critical and commercial sucess, with the lattermost winning the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The albums spawned multiple international hit singles, including "Just the Way You Are", "Grenade", "The Lazy Song", "Locked Out of Heaven", "When I Was Your Man", "Treasure", "24K Magic", "That's What I Like" and "Finesse". He also featured on Mark Ronson's 2014 single "Uptown Funk", which became Billboard's best-performing song of the 2010s.

Mars' success continued throughout the 2020s. In 2021, he formed the musical superduo Silk Sonic with Anderson .Paak, and they released the 1970's R&B-inspired album An Evening with Silk Sonic, which contained the US number-one single "Leave the Door Open". Mars' 2024 chart-topping duets "Die with a Smile" (with Lady Gaga) and "Apt." (with Rosé) spent a total of 27 weeks atop the Billboard Global 200.

Mars has sold over 150 million records worldwide and is one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He scored nine Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles. His 24K Magic World Tour (2017–2018) ranks among the highest-grossing tours in history. Mars' accolades include 16 Grammy Awards (including three Records of the Year and two Songs of the Year), four Brit Awards, eleven American Music Awards, 13 Soul Train Awards and three Guinness World Records. He has been featured on Music Week's best-songwriters (2011) and Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists (2019) lists, as well as the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100 lists. Mars was the first artist with six RIAA diamond-certified songs and the first artist to surpass 150 million monthly listeners on Spotify.

## Life and career

### 1985–2003: Early life and musical beginnings

Peter Gene Hernandez was born on October 8, 1985, in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Peter Hernandez and Bernadette San Pedro Bayot. He grew up in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu. His father has Puerto Rican and Jewish heritage and is from Brooklyn, New York. Mars has said that his Jewish ancestors were from Hungary and Ukraine. His mother emigrated from the Philippines to Hawaii, and had Filipino and Spanish ancestry. Mars' parents met while performing in a show in which his mother was a hula dancer and his father was a percussionist. At age two, he was nicknamed "Bruno" by his father because of his resemblance to professional wrestler Bruno Sammartino.

Mars is one of six children and came from a musical family who exposed him to a diverse mix of musical genres, including rock and roll, reggae, hip hop, and rhythm and blues. His mother was a singer and a dancer and his father performed Little Richard's music, which inspired him as a young child. His uncle, an Elvis impersonator, encouraged the three-year-old Mars to perform songs by Presley and Michael Jackson. Mars began performing five days a week with his family's band (the Love Notes) at age four, and became known in Hawaii for his onstage impersonation of Elvis Presley. He urinated on himself during a performance of Presley's "Can't Help Falling in Love" when he was five; his parents thought they might be making a mistake, but he never wavered. Mars appeared in the Hawaiian tabloid shopper MidWeek as "Little Elvis" in 1990, and performed in the halftime show of the 1990 Aloha Bowl.

He had a cameo role in the 1992 film Honeymoon in Vegas, and was interviewed by Pauly Shore on MTV. When Mars was six years old, he appeared on The Arsenio Hall Show. He performed two shows a night throughout grade school with his family's band, covering Frankie Lymon and Little Anthony songs. The young Mars had a small drum set, guitar, piano and percussion instruments, and learned to play them. His parents divorced when he was 12 (ending the Love Notes), and his father's varied businesses failed. Mars, his brother and father lived in the "slums of Hawaii" in a car, on rooftops, and in a closed bird zoo (Paradise Park) where his father had worked. Mars changed schools and was bullied, but later became popular.

His Elvis impersonations had a major impact on his musical evolution and performing technique. Mars began playing guitar, inspired by American rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix. In 2010, he acknowledged his Hawaiian roots and musical family as an influence: "Growing up in Hawaii made me the man I am. I used to do a lot of shows in Hawaii with my father's band. Everybody in my family sings, everyone plays instruments ... I've just been surrounded by it." At President Theodore Roosevelt High School in Honolulu, Mars sang in a group (the School Boys) who opened for his father's new band with songs by the Isley Brothers and the Temptations. He became well-known in Hawaiian entertainment in high school, opening for a large magic show and impersonating Michael Jackson for $75 per performance.

After his sister in Los Angeles played a demo for Mike Lynn (head of A&R at Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment label), Lynn summoned Mars to Los Angeles. In 2003, shortly after graduating from high school, Mars pursued a musical career. He lived on Mansfield Avenue, and was surprised by its poverty and squalor. Mars adopted his stage name from his father's childhood nickname, adding "Mars" at the end: "I felt like I didn't have no pizzazz, and a lot of girls say I'm out of this world, so I was like I guess I'm from Mars." His stage name was also an effort to "avoid being stereotyped", since the music industry tried to pigeonhole him as another Latin artist and tried to convince him to sing in Spanish.

### 2004–2008: Career beginnings

> I'd always been a working musician in Hawaii and never had problems paying rent. And then it's like, "Now I'm in L.A. and my phone's getting shut off". That's when reality hit. I started DJing. I told this person I could DJ because they said they could pay me $75 cash under the table. I didn't know how to DJ. I lost that job pretty quick.

— —Mars about moving to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career.

Mars signed a contract with Motown Records in 2004, but the deal "went nowhere" and he had a fruitless conversation with will.i.am's management. However, the singer's experience with Motown proved beneficial. After Mars was dropped by the label, less than a year later, he remained in Los Angeles and landed a 2005 music-publishing deal with record producers Steve Lindsey and Cameron Strang at Westside Independent. According to Strang, "Bruno came to the conclusion that the best way to further his career was writing and producing hit songs."

Lindsey showed Mars and fellow songwriters Brody Brown and Jeff Bhasker (whom Mars met through Mike Lynn) the ins and outs of writing pop music and acted as a mentor, helping them hone their craft. Bhasker explained that Lindsey would "mentor us, and kind of give us lectures as to what a hit pop song is, because you can have talent and music ability, but understanding what makes a hit pop song is a whole other discipline." According to Lindsey, he "held Mars back for five years while they learned an extensive catalog of hit music." Brown agreed in another interview. Mars played cover songs around Los Angeles in Sex Panther, a band with Bhasker and Eric Hernandez (Mars' brother, who became the drummer of the Hooligans).

When Lawrence was told he should meet Mars, he was reluctant to do so since he did not have money for bus fare. Keith Harris, drummer for the Black Eyed Peas, told Lawrence: "Whatever it costs you to get out here, I'll reimburse you." Lawrence replied, "Just give me five dollars back for the bus." The pair began collaborating on songs for Mars, but received a number of rejections from record labels. Lawrence introduced Mars to Aaron Bay-Schuck, his future A&R manager at Atlantic Records, in 2006. After hearing him play a couple of songs on guitar, Bay-Schuck wanted to sign him immediately. It took about three years for Atlantic Records to sign Mars, however, because the label felt it was too early and he needed to develop as an artist.

### 2008–2010: Production work and It's Better If You Don't Understand

They received a call in 2008 from Brandon Creed, who was looking for songs for a reunited Menudo. Creed liked their song "Lost", which was written for Mars, and bought it for $20,000. The sale allowed them to continue working, and Mars and Lawrence decided that they would write and produce songs for other artists. Eventually Creed became Mars' manager for nine years.

Mars was a music producer before becoming a successful solo artist, writing songs for Alexandra Burke, Adam Levine, Brandy, Sean Kingston, and K'naan. He said that the first "big hit" he and Lawrence wrote was the 2009 single, "Right Round", by Flo Rida: "That was our first taste of what could really happen with a hit we hundred-percented". Mars co-wrote the Sugababes's "Get Sexy" (2009) and provided backing vocals on their album, Sweet 7 (2010). He sang on the track "3D" on Far East Movement's second studio album, Animal (2009). Mars appeared on American pastor and hip hop artist Jaeson Ma's debut single, "Love", and American rapper Travie McCoy's "One at a Time" (a charity single for MTV's Staying Alive foundation) that year. He was recognized as a solo artist after appearing on American rapper B.o.B's "Nothin' on You" (2009) and McCoy's "Billionaire" (2010); both songs peaked in the top ten of several music charts, with the former topping the United States Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.

Mars said about the singles, "I think those songs weren't meant to be full-sung songs. If I'd sung all of 'Nothin' on You', it might've sounded like some '90s R&B." He released his debut extended play (EP), It's Better If You Don't Understand, on May 11, 2010. It peaked at number 99 on the US Billboard 200, and a music video was released for "The Other Side" with singer CeeLo Green and B.o.B. Mars and the Smeezingtons composed Green's successful 2010 single, "Fuck You".

### 2010–2012: Doo-Wops and Hooligans

Mars released "Just the Way You Are" on July 20, 2010, as the lead single of his debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, produced primarily by the Smeezingtons. It topped the charts of several countries, including Australia, Canada and the U.S. The album, released on October 5, 2010, debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and topped the UK, Dutch and Canadian. Doo-Wops & Hooligans has sold 15.5 million copies worldwide. It spawned two other singles: "Grenade" (which topped the Billboard Hot 100, New Zealand, UK, and other charts) and "The Lazy Song", which topped the UK and Danish charts.

Other singles include "Talking to the Moon", which was released in Brazil and topped Billboard Brasil's Hot Pop Songs and Hot 100 Airplay charts. "Marry You" was released internationally and "Count On Me" was the album's final single in Australia. Mars released "It Will Rain" on The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 film soundtrack (2011). The single reached number three in the U.S. and number two in New Zealand. He appeared on "Lighters" with the hip-hop duo Bad Meets Evil, "Mirror" with rapper Lil Wayne, and "Young, Wild & Free" with rappers Wiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg. The songs reached the top 20 of several countries and two top tens in the US.

Mars began to promote his debut album as the opening act for Maroon 5 and OneRepublic on the fall leg of the former's Palm Trees & Power Lines Tour. On October 18, 2010, he began a co-headlining European concert tour with McCoy which lasted until early November. The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour, which Mars headlined, ran from November 2010 to January 2012. During this time, the co-headlining Hooligans in Wondaland Tour with Mars and Janelle Monáe played North American dates in May and June 2011. Mars turned down offers to open for arena tours, opting instead to play at smaller venues such as theaters and ballrooms; this was less lucrative, but expanded his fan base.

At the 2011 Grammy Awards, Mars won his first Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for "Just the Way You Are" and received other six nominations: Best Rap Song, Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Record of the Year for "Nothin' on You"; the latter category and Song of the Year for "Fuck You" by CeeLo Green, and Producer of the Year, Non-Classical (as the Smeezingtons). At the 2012 Grammy Awards, Mars was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for Doo-Wops & Hooligans, and Best Pop Solo Performance, Record and Song of the Year for "Grenade"; Producer of the Year, Non-Classical (as the Smeezingtons). Mars received his first American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist, International Male Solo Artist at the Brit Awards, and the Echo Award for Best International Male.

### 2012–2014: Unorthodox Jukebox and Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show

In March 2012, Mars signed a worldwide publishing deal with BMG Chrysalis US. In a September 2012 interview for Billboard magazine, he affirmed his next album would be more varied musically: "I want to have the freedom and luxury to walk into a studio and say, 'Today I want to do a hip-hop, R&B, soul or rock record'". Unorthodox Jukebox was released on December 11, 2012 in the US. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 before topping the chart. It also topped the charts in Australia, Canada and the UK. It has sold over six million copies worldwide.

"Locked out of Heaven" was released in October 2012 and preceded the release of Unorthodox Jukebox, an album produced primarily by the Smeezingtons. The song topped the U.S. and Canadian charts and peaked at number two in the UK; it reached the top ten in several other countries. Other singles released from the album include "When I Was Your Man", "Treasure", "Gorilla" and "Young Girls". "When I Was Your Man" topped the Billboard Hot 100; except for Elvis Presley, no other male artist has had five number-one singles faster than Mars. The song peaked at number three in Canada, number two in the UK, and reached the top-ten in several other countries. Mars contributed vocals to the EDM trio Major Lazer's "Bubble Butt", released in May 2013. The single also includes the rappers Tyga and 2 Chainz and singer Mystic.

Mars' second headlining concert tour, the Moonshine Jungle Tour, lasted from June 2013 to October 2014. He announced his first concert residency, Bruno Mars at the Chelsea, Las Vegas. The tour grossed $156.4 million. On September 8, 2013, Mars was announced as headline performer at the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show with the Red Hot Chili Peppers as guests. The first Super Bowl halftime show headlined by a performer under 30 in a decade. At the time, it was the most-watched halftime show in the history of the Super Bowl (115.3 million viewers, more than for the game itself).

At the 2014 Grammy Awards, Mars received the Best Pop Vocal Album award for Unorthodox Jukebox. "Locked Out of Heaven" was nominated for Record and Song of the Year, and "When I Was Your Man" was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance. That year, the album received a Juno Award for International Album of the Year. Mars was cast as Roberto in the film Rio 2 (2014), and contributed to its soundtrack with the song "Welcome Back". On November 10, 2014, Mark Ronson released "Uptown Funk" with Mars. The song topped the charts in several countries, including Australia, Canada and New Zealand. "Uptown Funk" spent fourteen weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 and seven weeks atop the UK Singles Chart, impacting pop culture.

### 2015–2018: Super Bowl 50 halftime performance and 24K Magic

In September 2014, Mars began working on his third studio album but had not come up with a date: "Until it's done ... It's gotta be just as good if not better". At the 2016 Grammy Awards, "Uptown Funk" earned Ronson and Mars a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Record of the Year. A week earlier, Coldplay headlined the Super Bowl 50 halftime show with Mars and Beyoncé guesting; it was their second appearance on a Super Bowl halftime show. It was one of the most-watched halftime shows.

The album, scheduled for release in March, was postponed for several months due to Mars' Super Bowl halftime appearance; seven songs had been recorded. They were written primarily by Shampoo Press & Curl, a production team consisting of Mars, Lawrence and Brown which replaced the Smeezingtons. Mars began Gorilla Management, operated by Aaron Elharar, in May 2016. At the 2017 Grammy Awards, he shared the Album of the Year award as part of the Smeezingtons on Adele's "All I Ask" from 25 (2015). According to Guinness World Records 2017, Mars was the "First Male Artist to achieve three 10-million-selling-singles".

24K Magic, released on November 18, 2016, debuted at number two in Canada, France, New Zealand, and the US. It sold over five million copies globally. Its singles "24K Magic", "That's What I Like" and a remix of "Finesse" with rapper Cardi B, reached the top four of the US and the top-three in Canada. "That's What I Like" topped the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number four in New Zealand, while "Finesse" reached number two in New Zealand. "24K Magic" peaked at number one in France and New Zealand. Other singles include "Versace on the Floor" and "Chunky" (released in Australia). All singles appeared on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs; "That's What I Like" and "Finesse" topped the chart.

In 2016, Mars began the concert residency Bruno Mars at Park MGM. His headlining tour, 24K Magic World Tour (2017–18), grossed more than $300 million. On November 2017, CBS aired the TV special Bruno Mars: 24K Magic Live at the Apollo. Mars received seven 2017 American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year, two for "That's What I Like" and another two for 24K Magic. He received the Album/Mixtape of the Year award and four others at the 2017 Soul Train Music Awards. At the 2018 Grammy Awards, Mars won all the categories he was nominated: Album of the Year and Best R&B Album for 24K Magic, Record of the Year for the title track and Song of The Year, Best R&B Performance, and Best R&B Song for "That's What I Like". 24K Magic received a Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.

### 2018–2022: Further collaborations and An Evening with Silk Sonic

According to Nile Rodgers, Mars worked on Chic's studio album It's About Time (2018). In early 2018, he worked with recording engineer Charles Moniz and the songwriting-and-recording Stereotypes. Mars and rappers Gucci Mane and Kodak Black released "Wake Up in the Sky" for Mane's thirteenth studio album, Evil Genius, in September of that year; it reached number 11 in the U.S. In February 2019, he and Cardi B released "Please Me". The single peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, and reached the top 20 in Canada, New Zealand and the UK. Mars, Ed Sheeran and Chris Stapleton collaborated on "Blow" five months later for Sheeran's fourth studio album, No.6 Collaborations Project (2019). Mars posted a picture of himself in a recording studio in October of that year, hinting at new music.

A partnership was announced in February 2020 between Mars and Disney for a "music-themed theatrical narrative" in which the singer would star in and produce the film. A month later, it was confirmed that Mars was working on his next album with Babyface. During the COVID-19 lockdown, he wrote music every day for his upcoming album. That year, Mars sold part of his song catalog to Warner Chappell Music and kept a small share; his co-publishing contract with BMG was also part of the deal. In 2021, Mars was reportedly paid $3.2 million to perform at the Cape Cod wedding of the Motorola CEO's son.

On February 26, 2021, Mars and rapper Anderson .Paak announced that they recorded an album as Silk Sonic. An Evening with Silk Sonic, released on November 12 of that year, includes Bootsy Collins as a guest host. Primarily produced by Mars and D'Mile, debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and in the top five in Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

### 2023–present: World tour and fifth studio album

Mars continued his Bruno Mars at Park MGM concert residency in 2022, and began a world tour with shows in Sydney and Tokyo. The tour continued in 2023 in South Korea, the Philippines, Brazil, Chile, Georgia, Qatar and Israel. The following year, after dates in Tokyo, Bangkok and Singapore, the tour ended with a 14-show leg in Brazil. He kept performing shows at his concert residency alongside the world tour. The 37 shows reported during 2023 grossed more than $66.3 million.

In 2023, Mars was working on his next studio album with Brody Brown, Philip Lawrence and James Fauntleroy. The album was reportedly near completion that May, with a new sound and a tentative release date. Mars was in early talks with Live Nation Entertainment for a 2024–2025 tours. In 2024, D'Mile was involved on the singer's follow up album. In 2025, Andrew Watt and Andrew Wyatt said they had worked on a song with Mars and D'Mile affirmed he was working with the singer on his studio album.

Mars and Lady Gaga released their single, "Die with a Smile", on August 16, 2024.

## Artistry

### Influences

Mars was raised on his father's 1950s doo-wop collection ("simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point") and on Little Richard, Frankie Lymon, Little Anthony, and Jerry Lee Lewis. As a child he impersonated Elvis Presley, affecting Mars' musical evolution:

> I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and I love studying them because I'm a fan.

Mars also impersonated Michael Jackson (another inspiration), and hip-hop songs by The Neptunes and Timbaland which were played on the radio influenced him.

Mars' musical style initially gravitated towards R&B, and he was influenced by Keith Sweat, Jodeci, and R. Kelly. He noticed Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, New Edition, Bobby Brown, Boyz II Men, Teddy Riley and Babyface as a child, and listened to 1950s rock 'n' roll, doo-wop and Motown. Mars listened to Led Zeppelin and the Beatles in high school, and to singers with high voices such as Stevie Wonder and Freddie Mercury. Bob Marley and local bands in Hawaii gave Mars his reggae roots. Hip-hop acts like Jay-Z, the Roots and Cody Chesnutt were favorites, influencing his songwriting. Each musical genre has influenced the singer's style: "It's not easy to [create] songs with that mixture of rock and soul and hip-hop, and there's only a handful of them."

Other inspirations include Janet Jackson, Jimi Hendrix, Amy Winehouse, Sly Stone, Carlos Santana, George Clinton, and Usher. Mars has said that he is a fan of Alicia Keys, Jessie J, Jack White, the Saturdays, and Kings of Leon.

### Musical style and themes

Mars' music has been noted for a variety of styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop, R&B, funk, soul, reggae, and rock. His debut album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, is primarily a pop, reggae pop and R&B record. Many of Mars' songs on the album have "feel-good", carefree, optimistic sentiments. Darker subjects in his songs, however, address failed relationships, pain and loneliness. Mars' subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox (like his debut album) is influenced by disco, funk, rock, reggae and soul, and balladry. His second album differs from the first lyrically, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism and sexuality; the explicit content in "Gorilla" sparked controversy in Australia. Mars's third album, 24K Magic, was influenced by R&B, funk, pop and new jack swing. Lyrically, the album involves money and sex. An Evening with Silk Sonic is the debut studio album by Silk Sonic, composed of Mars and Anderson .Paak. The album is rooted in R&B, soul, funk, hip hop and pop music. It explores themes of seduction, romance, reconciliation and materialism.

### Voice

Mars has a three-octave tenor vocal range. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called him one of the most "versatile and accessible singers in pop, with a light, soul-influenced voice that's an easy fit in a range of styles, a universal donor", and Tim Sendra of AllMusic described the singer's vocals on Doo-Wops & Hooligans as "the kind of smooth instrument that slips into your ear like honey." Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone called Mars a "nimble, soulful vocalist" on Unorthodox Jukebox. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News likened his voice to "the purity, cream and range of mid-period Michael Jackson" in a review of a concert promoting Unorthodox Jukebox. On 24K Magic, Consequence of Sound's Karen Gwen said that Mars showed his "pips" and pushed his vocals to the limit. She described his voice as a "clear, unapologetic tenor" and a modern-day "blessing". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that 24K Magic demonstrated the singer's vocal ability, from tenderness to "the more forceful side of his voice".

### Songwriting

Mars has described his writing process: "I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song'"; inspiration comes out of the blue in different places. Ideas occur suddenly to him and, occasionally, he can materialize them into lyrics. He has said that he typically writes songs by playing the guitar or piano. Mars plays drums, guitar, keyboard, bass, piano, ukulele, and congas. He usually plays the instrumentation (or part of it) on his albums and the songs he composes for other artists.

Mars says his work with other artists influenced his music style: "Nothin' on You had a Motown vibe, Billionaire was a reggae acoustic guitar-driven song, though one of my favorites is the CeeLo Green song. I don't think anyone else could've sung that song. And there's Just the Way You Are. If you know my story, you know I love all different genres of music." Growing up in Hawaii has influenced his style, giving the songs a reggae sound: "In Hawaii some of the biggest radio stations are reggae. That music brings people together. It's not urban music or pop music. It's just songs. That's what makes it cross over so well. The song comes first."

Although music partner Philip Lawrence said that Mars has a darker side, most of his music is romantic: "I blame that on me singing to girls back in high school". Brody Brown, who has worked with Mars, said that the singer is in charge of the melody and lyrics of his tracks: "I'll just do the music, but Bruno does both. I chime in on some things with words, but the majority of the content is written by Bruno and Phil (Lawrence)."

### Showmanship

Mars is known for his retro showmanship, which is acclaimed by tour critics and reviewers. Deanna Ramsay of The Jakarta Post described Mars as a "truly global star". The Boston Herald's Jim Sullivan compared Mars' showmanship to that of Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley. Kevin Johnson of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch called Mars a "consummate performer." The Boston Globe's Sarah Rodman said Mars shows an "indefatigable ecstatic approach to performing" and "classic showmanship." Jim Farber of the Daily News said Mars's Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show "[brought] old-school showmanship to [a] dynamic performance." Mars played videotapes of Elvis, James Brown and Jackson when he was younger. Now, before shows, he watches Brown's T.A.M.I. Show, Jimi Hendrix's Live at Woodstock or Prince performing "Purple Rain" (1984).

During the Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour, Ara Jansan of The West Australian called the show "one of the most creative and exciting displays of musical artistry" she had seen in a long time and noted the concert attracted a wide-age-range audience. On the Hooligans in Wondaland Tour, the Oregonian's Robert Ham noted, that Mars grabbed the audience's attention during the entire concert and had considerable guitar skills. During the Moonshine Jungle Tour, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard described the singer's performance as "entertaining ...and he does a better job at it than almost anyone working in music right now". Rolling Stone ranked Mars 35th on its list of 50 Best Live Acts Right Now in 2013: "Anyone from the age of 5 to 95 can walk out of a Bruno Mars concert feeling like the show was designed just for them. Mars walks the old-school walk...he also nails the hits, leads a super-energetic nine-piece soul band, and rips a mean drum solo". NFL executives Sarah Moll and Tracy Perlman said, "If you go to his concerts, it's 11-year-old girls to 65-year-old women" after seeing the Moonshine Jungle tour several times during the summer of 2013. The 24K Magic World Tour was praised by critics for its showmanship, guitar skills and stage production. The tour received two Pollstar awards, two Billboard Music Awards, and a TEC Award. Bruno Mars at Park MGM concert residency won Top R&B Tour at the 2022 Billboard Music Awards.

Mars' concerts feature The Hooligans, including a guitarist, bassist, drummer, keyboardist and horn section, who are also dancers and background singers. Critics noted the difference the backup band and arrangements made to the live versions of the songs compared with the album versions. The shows contained all-band dancing arrangements, including footwork inspired by James Brown and the splits. The shows, influenced by disco, have a soul-revue-inspired set; long, mellow, soft interludes echoing the smooth contemporary R&B style popular during the 1990s are also included. The set lists blend several genres of music, including pop, doo-wop, funk, R&B, soul, and reggae. Mars' shows usually feature pyrotechnics, strobe and laser lighting, and he plays drums and guitar. In 2021, Pollstar named Mars the hip-hop/R&B touring artist of the 2010s.

### Music videos

Mars has collaborated with several directors to produce his music videos, and has emerged as a music-video director. From 2010 to 2017, Mars co-directed ten music videos from his albums Doo-Wops & Hooligans, Unorthodox Jukebox, 24K Magic, and singles with Cameron Duddy. In 2011, Mars developed the second concept and treatment for "The Lazy Song" and brought in Duddy to co-direct its music video. In an interview, Duddy said that he and Mars "can fight...when it comes to doing music videos. The best collaborations are always fueled by opposite perspectives or alternative ideas. We always find a common ground."

In 2018, Mars co-directed the music video for "Finesse" with Florent Dechard. He collaborated with Dechard on music videos for "Please Me", "Blow", "Leave the Door Open" and "Skate". In 2024, Mars co-directed the Don Quijote campaign commercial with Daniel Ramos. The singer collaborated with Ramos on music videos for "Die with a Smile", "Apt." and "Fat, Juicy and Wet".

Mars, who choreographed the video for "Treasure", received the Best Choreography award at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. Mars and Duddy's work was recognized at several awards shows, including two nominations for an MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction (for "Uptown Funk" and "24K Magic"). Mars' collaborations with Dechard earned them a nomination for Video Director of the Year at the 2019 BET Hip Hop Awards. In 2017, "That's What I Like" (directed by Mars and Jonathan Lia) led them to a nomination at the BET Awards 2017 for Video Director of the Year. The following year, Mars and Ben Winston's direction of Bruno Mars: 24K Magic Live at the Apollo (2017) earned them a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Direction. Mars and Dechard directed the video for "Leave the Door Open" in 2021, for which they received the BET Award for Video Director of the Year award. The video also received the 2021 MTV Video Music Award for Best Editing.

###Clothing

Mars wears outfits inspired by previous decades, and matches that aesthetic to his music. On Doo-Wops and Hooligans, the singer wore '60s-inspired suits and had faded hair; on 24K Magic, Mars channeled the 1980s and 1990s in sound and aesthetic. He imposed a dress code in the studio during the recording of that album, favoring jewelry and "fine clothes" over sweatpants to create "groovy, smooth and soulful songs". When Mars collaborated with Anderson .Paak on Silk Sonic in 2021, he wore the "wide collars, leisure suits, and funky patterns" common during the 1970s; this complemented their sound. For InStyle, Tessa Petak wrote: "Regardless of the decade he's emulating, Mars's fashion sense and stage presence make him larger-than-life".
