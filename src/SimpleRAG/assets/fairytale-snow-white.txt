Title: The fairytale of Snow White
Author: Brothers Grimm

Once upon a time in midwinter, when the snowflakes were falling from the sky like down, a queen was sitting and sewing at a window which had a frame of black ebony. And as she sewed at the window and glanced up at the snow, she pricked her finger with her needle and three drops of blood fell on to the snow. And because the red looked so beautiful on the white snow, she thought to herself: if only I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the wood in the window frame. Not long afterwards she had a little daughter who was as white as snow, as red as blood, and with hair as black as ebony, and because of that she was called Snow White. And as the child was born, the queen died.

A year later the king took another wife. She was a beautiful woman, but she was proud and arrogant and could not endure it that anyone should surpass her in beauty. She had a marvellous mirror, and when she stood in front of it and gazed at herself, she would say:


"Mirror, mirror on the wall.

Who is the fairest one of all?"

And the mirror would answer:

"Lady, you are the fairest one of all."

Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the mirror was telling the truth.

But Snow White was growing up, becoming more and more beautiful, and when she was seven years old she was as fair as the bright day and fairer than the queen herself. One day, when the queen asked her mirror:

"Mirror, mirror on the wall,

Who is the fairest one of all?"

The mirror answered:

"Lady, you are the fairest here,

But Snow White is a thousand times more fair."

This horrified the queen, who turned yellow and green with envy. From that hour, whenever she saw Snow White her heart would turn over in her body, she hated the girl so much. And envy and arrogance grew in her heart like a weed, taller and taller, so that day and night she no longer had any peace. So she called a huntsman to her and told him: "Take the child out into the forest. I don't want to set eyes on her again. You are to kill her, and bring me her lungs and liver as a token." The huntsman obeyed and led the child out into the forest. And just as he had drawn his hunting knife and was about to stab Snow White in her innocent heart, she began to cry, saying: "Oh, huntsman dear, spare my life; I'll run away into the wild wood and never come home again." And because she was so fair, the huntsman took pity on her and said: "Run away then, you poor child." The wild animals will soon have eaten you up, he thought, but even so he felt as if a stone had been lifted from his heart because he didn't need to kill her. And as a young boar-piglet came leaping by just at that moment, he stabbed him, took out his lungs and liver, and brought them to the queen as a token. The cook was commanded to stew them in salt, and the wicked woman ate them up, imagining it was Snow White's lungs and liver she had eaten.

Now the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and she grew so frightened that she gazed at all the leaves on the trees and didn't know what to do to save herself. And so she began to run, and she ran over the sharp stones and through the thorns, and the wild animals leapt past her, but they did her no harm. She ran for as long as her feet could carry her, until it was nearly evening. Then she saw a little house, and she went inside to rest. Everything in the little house was very small, but I just can't tell you how neat and clean it was. There was a little table with a white cloth, laid with seven little plates, each plate with its little spoon, seven little knives and forks as well, and seven little cups. Against the wall there were seven little beds, arranged side by side and covered with sheets as white as snow. Because Snow White was so hungry and thirsty she ate some bread and greens from each little plate, and drank a drop of wine from each little cup, for she didn't want to take it all from just one. Afterwards, because she was so tired, she lay down on one of the little beds, but none of them was the right size for her: this one was too long, that one too short, until at last the seventh was just right. So she remained lying on that one, entrusted herself to God, and fell asleep.

When it had grown quite dark the masters of the little house arrived. They were the seven dwarves who dug and mined for ore in the mountains. They lit their seven little lanterns, and as it grew bright in the little house they saw that somebody had been there, for everything was not in the order they had left it in. The first said: "Who's been sitting on my chair?" The second: "Who's been eating from my plate?" The third: "Who's taken some of my bread?" The fourth: "Who's eaten some of my greens?" The fifth: "Who's been using my fork?" The sixth: "Who's been using my knife?" The seventh: "Who's been drinking from my cup?" Then the first turned round and, seeing that there was a little dent on his bed, he said: "Who's tried out my bed?" The others ran up, and cried: "Somebody's been lying in my bed too." But when the seventh looked at his bed, he saw Snow White lying there asleep. Then he called the others, who came running up, and they cried out in amazement. They fetched their seven little lanterns and threw their light on Snow White. "Oh, good Lord! Good Lord!" they cried. "What a beautiful child!" And they were so joyful that they didn't wake her up, but let her go on sleeping in the little bed. As for the seventh dwarf, he slept with his fellows, an hour apiece with each of them. And so the night passed.


When morning came Snow White woke, and when she saw the seven dwarves she was startled. But they were friendly, asking: "What's your name?" "My name is Snow White," she replied. "How did you come to be in our house?" the dwarves asked again. Then she told them the story of how her stepmother had wanted to have her killed, but the huntsman had spared her life, and then she had run and run all day long until at last she had found their little house. The dwarves said: "If you will keep house for us, cook and make the beds, wash and sew and knit, and if you will keep everything tidy and clean, you can stay with us and you shall lack for nothing." "Yes," said Snow White, "with all my heart," and she stayed with them. She kept their house in order; in the mornings they went out into the mountains in search of ore and gold; in the evenings they came back and their meal had to be ready for them. Throughout the day the girl was on her own, so the good little dwarves warned her: "Beware your stepmother. She'll soon find out that you're here; don't, don't let anyone in."

As for the queen, once she believed she had eaten Snow White's lungs and liver she had no other thought but that she was once again the first and foremost and most beautiful of all. So she came and stood in front of her mirror and said:

"Mirror, mirror on the wall,

Who is the fairest one of all?"

Then the mirror answered:

"Lady, you are the fairest here,

But Snow White, living far away

With the seven dwarves this day,

Is still a thousand times more fair."

At that she was horrified, for she knew that the mirror did not lie, and she realised that the huntsman had deceived her and that Snow White was still alive. And then she racked her brains again and again to think how she could kill her, for as long as she was not the fairest one of all her envy would not leave her in peace. And when at last she had thought of a plan, she stained her face and dressed up like an old pedlar-woman, and she was quite unrecognisable. In this shape she crossed the seven mountains to the seven dwarves, knocked on their door, and called: "Fine wares for sale! Going cheap! Going cheap!" Snow White peeked out of the window and called: "Good morning, good woman! What have you for sale?" "Good wares, fine wares," she answered. "Laces for your bodice in every colour," and she produced one woven of brightly coloured silk. I can let this good woman in, thought Snow White. She unbolted the door and bought herself a set of pretty laces. "My child," said the old woman, "what a sight you are! Come, I'll lace your bodice properly!" Snow White wasn't suspicious, stood in front of her, and allowed herself to be laced up with the new laces. But the old woman laced fast and she laced so tight that Snow White lost her breath and fell down as if she were dead. "Now you were once the fairest of all," said the old woman, and hurried out.

Not long afterwards, at eventide, the seven dwarves came home, but how horrified they were when they saw their dear Snow White lying on the ground. She didn't stir or move, as if she were dead. They lifted her up, and because they saw that her lacing was too tight, they cut her laces. Then she began to breathe a little, and bit by bit she came back to life. When the dwarves heard what had happened they declared: "That old pedlar-woman was no one but the godless queen. Take care and don't let anybody in if we are not here with you."

As for the wicked woman, when she came home she went before her mirror and asked:

"Mirror, mirror on the wall,

Who is the fairest one of all?"

And it replied, as it always did:

"Lady you are the fairest here,

But Snow White, living far away

With the seven dwarves this day,

Is still a thousand times more fair."

When she heard that, all the blood drained from her heart, she was so horrified, for she realised that Snow White had come back to life. "But now," she said, "I'll think up something that shall destroy you." And with the black arts she commanded she made a poisoned comb. Then she disguised herself, taking on the shape of another old woman. In this guise she crossed the seven mountains to the seven dwarves, knocked at the door, and called: "Good wares going cheap, going cheap!" Snow White looked out and said: "Go your ways, I mustn't let anyone in." "Surely you're allowed to look," said the old woman, taking out the poisoned comb and holding it up. The girl liked it so much that she let herself be fooled and opened the door. When they had agreed on the sale the old woman said: "Now I'll comb your hair properly." Poor Snow White suspected nothing, and let the old woman have her way. But the comb had hardly touched her hair before the poison in it took effect and the girl fell down unconscious. "You paragon of beauty," said the wicked woman, "it's over with you now," and off she went. But as luck would have it, it was nearly evening, when the seven little dwarves would come home. When they saw Snow White lying on the ground as if she were dead they suspected her stepmother at once, so they looked carefully and found the poisoned comb. They had scarcely drawn it out before Snow White revived and told them what had happened. Then they warned her once again to be on her guard and to open her door to no one.


Back home, the queen stood before her mirror and said:

"Mirror, mirror on the wall,

Who is the fairest one of all?"

Then it answered, as it had before:

"Lady, you are the fairest here,

But Snow White, living far away

With the seven dwarves this day,

Is still a thousand times more fair."

When she heard the mirror speaking like this she shook and shuddered with rage. "Snow White shall die," she cried, "even if it costs my own life." And straight away she went off to the most secret, lonely little room, where no one came, and there she made a poisonous, poisonous apple. On the outside it looked lovely, white with rosy cheeks, so that the sight of it would make you want to take a bite, but whoever ate one morsel of it would be bound to die. When the apple was ready the queen stained her face and disguised herself as a peasant woman; in this guise she crossed the seven mountains to the seven dwarves. She knocked at their door. Snow White put her head out of the window and said: "I'm not allowed to let anyone at all inside; the seven dwarves have forbidden it." "That's all right by me," answered the peasant woman, "I want to be rid of my apples. There – I'll give you one." "No," said Snow White, "I'm not allowed to accept anything." "Are you afraid of being poisoned?" said the old woman. "Look, I'm cutting the apple in two; you shall eat the red cheek and I'll eat the white." But the apple had been made so cleverly that only the red cheek was poisoned. Snow White's mouth watered for the lovely apple, and when she saw the peasant woman eating a part of it she could no longer resist, but stretched out her hand and took the half that was poisoned. But she had scarcely taken a morsel of it in her mouth when she fell to the ground dead. Then the queen gazed at her with terrifying eyes, uttered a piercing laugh, and said: "White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony! This time the dwarves won't be able to wake you up again." And when, back at home, she questioned the mirror:

"Mirror, mirror on the wall,

Who is the fairest one of all?"

It answered her at last:

"Lady, you are the fairest one of all."

So her envious heart was at peace – as far as an envious heart can be at peace.

The little dwarves, when they arrived home that evening, found Snow White lying on the ground, and she breathed not a breath, and she was dead. They lifted her up, looking for something poisonous, loosened her bodice, combed her hair, washed her with water and wine, but all in vain; the dear girl was dead, and she remained dead. They laid her on a bier and took their places around it, all seven of them, and they shed tears over their loss, and they wept for three days. Then they were about to bury her, but she still looked as fresh as a living being, and still had her lovely red cheeks. "We can't lower her into the black earth," they said, and they had a transparent coffin of glass made, so that she could be seen from all sides. They laid her in the coffin and in letters of gold they wrote her name upon it, and that she was a king's daughter. Then they placed the coffin out on the mountain-side, and one of them always remained there to watch over it. And the animals, too, came up and wept for Snow White, first of all an owl, then a raven, and last of all a dove.


Now Snow White lay in her coffin for a long, long time, and she did not moulder, but looked as if she were asleep, for she was still as white as snow, as red as blood, with hair as black as ebony. But it happened that a king's son entered the forest and arrived at the dwarves' house, wanting to stay there for the night. He saw the coffin on the mountain-side, with the lovely Snow White within, and read what was written in letters of gold upon it. Then he said to the dwarves: "Let me have the coffin. I'll give you whatever you want in exchange." But the dwarves answered: "We won't give it for all the gold in the world." So he said: "Then grant it to me as a gift, for I cannot live without the sight of Snow White. I will honour and revere her as my dearest prize." As he spoke in this way, the good little dwarves took pity on him and gave him the coffin. The king's son then had it borne away on the shoulders of his servants. Then it happened that they stumbled over a branch, and the morsel of poisoned apple that Snow White had bitten was shaken out of her throat. It was not long before she opened her eyes, lifted the cover of the coffin, sat up, and was alive again. "Great heavens, where am I?" she cried. Full of joy, the king's son said: "You are with me," and he told her what had happened, declaring: "I love you more than everything in the world; come with me to my father's palace; you shall become my consort." So Snow White loved him, and went with him, and preparations for their wedding were made with great splendour and magnificence.

As for Snow White's godless stepmother, she too was invited to the celebration. When she had dressed herself in fine array, she stepped before the mirror and said:

"Mirror, mirror on the wall,

Who is the fairest one of all?"

The mirror answered:

"Lady, you are the fairest here,

But the young queen is a thousand times more fair."

At that the wicked woman uttered a curse, and she was filled with fear, such fear, that she didn't know what to do with herself. At first she didn't want to go to the wedding at all, but that gave her no peace: she had to go and see the young queen. And when she entered she recognised Snow White and she stood there in fear and terror, unable to stir. But iron slippers had already been set over a fire of coals, and they were carried in with tongs and placed before her. Then she was forced to put her feet into the red-hot shoes and dance until she fell to the ground dead.
